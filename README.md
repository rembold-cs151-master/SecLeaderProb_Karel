# SecLeaderProb_Karel

Write a program where Karel will place a single beeper at the center of 1st street. There should be no other beepers present in the world when Karel finishes. You are guaranteed the following:

- Karel starts at the corner of 1st avenue and 1st street, facing east, with an infinite amount of beepers in their bag.
- The initial state of the world includes no interior walls or beepers
- The world need not be square, but you can assume it is at least as tall as it is wide

You can also assume the following:

- If the width of the world is odd, Karel must place the beeper in the exact center. If the width of the world is even, then Karel may drop the beeper in either of the two center squares.
- It does not matter what direction Karel is facing at the end.


There are lots of different approaches you could take to this, but remember that Karel has no memory!
